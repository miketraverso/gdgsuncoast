  title: "Beginning Android Development Part I"
  description: "This is the first session of the Tampa based Beginning Android Development series. We'll start by getting everyone ready for the course and then begin to cover the material. During this session we'll be covering XML and how to use XML to create Android Views and ViewGroups. Next we'll get to programming our first Android app: a Greeting Card app that you'll build for someone special. After lunch we'll begin by covering how to handle button clicks, debug your app and how to create more complex layouts. We'll end the day by starting to develop our second Android app: a Basketball score keeping app. We'll also be on hand to help answer questions and help address any nasty bugs that you come across."
