Today we held our second Study Jam session at [Tampa Bay WaVE ](//www.tampabaywave.org/) and it was a pretty good time. We kicked off the session by going through what we covered last session and what students covered on their own this past week. We wrapped up with covering lesson 3 highlighting methods, conditionals, impostor syndrome, and intents.

You can find the presentations for these events over at:
