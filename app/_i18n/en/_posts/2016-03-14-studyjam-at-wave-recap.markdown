This past Saturday we held our first Study Jam at [Tampa Bay WaVE ](//www.tampabaywave.org/) and it was a pretty good time. We kicked off the session by going through the Udacity course together and then through the first practice set. We'll be wrapping up next week with our final Study Jam session for Beginning Android development at Tampa Bay WaVE this Saturday, 19 March 2016.

Here's a couple of photos of the event and one of some of the giveaways we'll have for our final session. If you've attended the first session, don't forget to [RSVP](//www.meetup.com/GDGSUNCOAST/events/229578687/) for the second or forget that we're having two Hangouts this week to help you out with any questions you may have as you progress through the course.
